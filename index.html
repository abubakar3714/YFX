            <div class="in-target">
              <div class="target-left">
                <p>I used to work at Target around Late 2014 – Mid 2015 to just show you how much of a regular person I am. I was making $9/hr with a $0.50 raise after working there for 3 months. January 2015 I began learning to trade in the Forex market and was able to make decent profits as a beginner.

                  But as I studied for several months, I noticed I was having good profitable days and a few bad days. One thing I did know during this process was that I was learning and making tons of progress. I had my first 1K day around March 2015, and since then life has just gotten better day by day, as I’m gaining more clarity in trading the markets.
                  
                  My major breakthrough and consistency came about 6-7 months later and gave me the confidence I needed to put in my two weeks, but I wasn’t sure if it was the right time yet. This was a time in my life, which required the biggest leap of FAITH that I’ve ever experienced, but having an Entrepreneur mindset, I WAS ALL ABOUT THE RISK BABY!

                <p>After trading and making consistent profits for four months, I began to meet others in my network to gain knowledge from them and from there I can add my own twist to how I analyze and trade the market. After meeting others that had the same passion for the markets and were also seeing consistent profits many wanted to learn from us. This was the start of movement Forever In Profit.</p>
